# argos3-template
A basic template for an argos3 simulator project

## How to run
```
argos3 -c template.argos
```

## Content
### Robot file
A 1 to 1 wrapper for the content of [the lua doc of the robot](https://www.argos-sim.info/plow2015/)
only adding documentation and helping LSPs understand the codebase better.

### Logger file
I was simply annyed by the fact that my LSP would keep on telling me that log was probably undefined so i added this.
